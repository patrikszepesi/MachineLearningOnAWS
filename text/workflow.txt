lambda functions can be individaul components of step functions

lambda:serveless computer service, perfect for small iterable tasks

trigger lambda functions/invocations:

2 types: synchronus and async
lambdas are provoked thru Events, an event is a JSON object,

event can be when we uploaded stuff to s3, like data so lambda runs
or we can have cloudwatch events, where certain events trigger lambda
cloudwatch scheduled events to run the lambda function

step functions=AWS orchestration service

abstractions:
 state machine: orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity
 task: single unit of work performed externally
 function orchestration: managed, ordered execution of tasks
 branching: path determination based on outcome of previous task


step functions expensive, use them when you have complex tasks than dont have to be run frequently
output of one function can be input of the next Function

branching path to catch errors
creating step functions with UI is easy but with boto3 its hard bc you have to use amazon language

sagemaker pipeline is AWS' CI/CD tool for ml jobs

unlike step functions, sagemaker pipelines are directly integrated into sagemaker, which makes more complex ml workflows easier to manage


AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premises data sources, at specified intervals. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly access your data where itâ€™s stored, transform and process it at scale, and efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.
